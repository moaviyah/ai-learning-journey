# Day 1 — What is Machine Learning (ML)

**Date:** _add date here_

---

## 1) Short summary — What I learned today
Machine Learning (ML) is the part of AI where machines **learn patterns from examples**.  
Instead of coding every rule, we give the computer many examples (data) and it finds the pattern to make predictions or decisions.

Key idea:
- **We teach by example.**  
- **Data → Learn → Predict.**

## 2) Mini practical: a tiny ML example (run locally)
This is a **very small** Python example using `scikit-learn` to train a classifier on the Iris dataset and print accuracy. It’s meant to give immediate hands-on proof that ML works.

### Setup (in your project venv)
```bash
# activate your venv first (windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# install basics (if not already)
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
