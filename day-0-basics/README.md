Day 0 â€” Starting the Journey

This marks the beginning of my AI Learning Journey.
Today, I focused on understanding the core idea behind Artificial Intelligence and why it matters.

What I Learned Today

What AI (Artificial Intelligence) means in simple words.

Real-life examples of AI being used around us.

How AI is not a robot or magic â€” it's a system that learns patterns and makes decisions.

Key Takeaway

AI is about making machines think and learn like humans â€” step by step.
This journey will be slow, consistent, and focused on building real understanding, not just theoretical knowledge.

Todayâ€™s Output

Created my first introductory video explaining what AI is in easy language.

Published the video across multiple platforms.

Set up my long-term content strategy (learning + teaching publicly).
